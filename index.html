          Bocelli showed a great passion for music as a young boy. His mother
          has said that music was the only thing that would comfort him. He
          started piano lessons at age 6 and later learned to play the flute,
          saxophone, trumpet, trombone, guitar, and drums.His nanny Oriana gave
          him the first record of Franco Corelli, and he began to show interest
          in pursuing the career of a tenor.By age 7, he was able to recognize
          the famous voices of the time and tried to emulate the great singers.
