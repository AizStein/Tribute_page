# Tribute Page

### Introduction

Welcome to my Tribute Page! This project is one of my first endeavors in web development, where I learned to use HTML and CSS to create a visually appealing and informative page dedicated to a person or topic that inspires me. This page showcases my understanding of basic web development principles and my ability to present information in a structured format.

### Project Features

- **HTML Structure:** The tribute page is built using semantic HTML to ensure accessibility and SEO best practices. The structure includes headings, paragraphs, images, and lists to present information clearly.
- **CSS Styling:** I applied custom styles using CSS to enhance the visual presentation of the page.

### Content

- **Biography:** A brief overview of the person's life and achievements.
- **Timeline:** Key events and milestones that highlight the person's journey.
- **Image:** Visual elements that represent the person or topic of tribute.
